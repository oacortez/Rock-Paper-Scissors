## Wins
- I try my best to be as Proffesional and try my best to create appropriate branches and as well commit frequently 
- I really liked the style for my comp of the project 
- I think I did very good on having semantic html did not have a lot of divs and spans

## Challenges + Improvements
- Local storage and event targeting was very diffuclt for me to grasp on and needed a lot of assistance 
- there was hardly no bugs but my naming conventions were very poorly named
- for future iterations I would like to work on better understanding in local storage and as well event targeting
- I would also like to improve better knowledge for naming conventions
